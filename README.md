# blokart Mast-Butt Ratchet Block Support

This item is designed to clip around the base/butt section of the 
blokart mast and provides a hook to keep the loop of line attached
to the mainsheet block up above the frame's base.

## 3D Printing Parameter Suggestions

### Filament
This is designed to spread apart a bit when it's clipped to the mast.
A filament that's not too stiff is preferred.
I've used PETG exclusively for the items I've printed, and they seem to
be holding up pretty well.

### Printing Parameters
I have always printed these standing up so the "clip" section can be 
printed with the perimeters running continuously around the clip. 
This avoids the lower strength of the inter-layer bond when they
are spread apart slightly without breaking when the clipped to the mast.

I've mostly printed these with solid perimeters (5) in the clip area,
but I've also experimented with using two perimeters and gyroid infill.

The "hook" section can have any infill you like. It's not a strength-critical area.
